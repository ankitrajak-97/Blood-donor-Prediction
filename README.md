# Blood donor Prediction
 Predict new blood donor on their blood donation approval

 Project Description :

Blood banks and hospitals receive a lot of applications for blood donation. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like previous donated date,health issues or too many inquiries on an individualâ€™s donor, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is error-prone, and time consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every hospital & blood bank doe so nowadays. In this project, I will build an automatic bloood donor approval predictor using machine learning techniques.

Motivation:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) : the process of going through a dataset and finding out more about it.

Model training: create models to learn to predict a target variable based on other variables.

Model evaluation :evaluating a models predictions using problem-specific evaluation metrics.

Model comparison:comparing several different models to find the best one.

Model fine-tuning :once we've found a good model, how can we improve it?

Feature importance To find out which are more important for prediction.

Problem Definition

In our case, the problem we will be exploring is binary classification
This is because we're going to be using a number of differnet features about a blood donor to predict whether they can donate on that time or not.
